                            <b>Network visualizations show connections between entities, called edges and nodes respectively.</b> 
                            Network visualizations are used across application domains. For example, in social network analysis, nodes represent people and edges represent their relationship(s), such as colleagues, friends, or lovers. Visualizing networks effectively can assist researchers and laypeople make sense of complex relational data, such as social networks, flight paths, or biochemical interaction networks.

                            In this study, however, we are particularly interested in how to visualize <b>attributes</b> attached to these nodes. In the context of a social network, for example, such attributes could describe a person's height, weight, political affiliation, etc. As these attributes can be <b>uncertain</b>, care must be taken in visualizing such attributes and their attached uncertainty in a meaningful way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here, this uncertainty can be visually represented in different ways. In this study, you will be shown one of multiple such visual encodings and tasked with answering multiple questions relating to the presented network's topology as well as its attributes. The study aims to evaluate the readability of the visual representation of the network and its attributes.
